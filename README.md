This is a website that shows the weather forecast and drive time report for some cool surf locations. As of 7/4/2020, I only have two locations in the SF Bay Area but I plan on adding more in the future.

To Run:

    Clone the Repo
    Type 'npm start'
    If you want to add your own locations, you must have both a Magic Seaweed(MSW) API Key AND a Mapbox API key.

## This project is currently not being maintained.

Due to time constraints and life changes, I am not able to maintain this project to the best of my abilities. I will leave the CORS proxy server up so feel free to use it in your own project (It is on a free-tier Heroku dyno so hopefully it wont be pinged too hard :)).
